# Cenary Standard

This repository contains specification of the [Cenary](https://github.com/cenary-lang/cenary) programming language.

## Syntax

[Here](https://github.com/cenary-lang/standard/blob/master/cenary.abnf), you can find the language syntax in ABNF form. (a bit outdated, PRs welcome).

## Language Reports

Cenary started as a 1-year senior project and continues being actively developed. In each term, a progress report has been written for that term's development, hence there are 4 reports:

* [Term 1 Midterm Prograss Report](https://github.com/cenary-lang/cenary/blob/master/standard/report_491_midterm/report.pdf)
* [Term 1 Final Progress Report](https://github.com/cenary-lang/cenary/blob/master/standard/report_491_final/report.pdf)
* [Term 2 Midterm Progress Report](https://github.com/cenary-lang/cenary/blob/master/standard/report_492_midterm/report.pdf)
* [Term 2 Final Progress Report](https://github.com/cenary-lang/cenary/blob/master/standard/report_492_final/report.pdf)
